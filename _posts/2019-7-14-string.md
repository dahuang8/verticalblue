## How to Convert 1 char to String

Note, to_string() is not working for char. So only the following ways work.

```c++
char c = 'a';
// method 1
string s(1,c);
// method 2
string s = string(1,c); // essentially same as method 1
// method 3
string s;
s.push_back(c);
```

$$\alpha + \beta = \sigma$$
